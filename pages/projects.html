                        <p class="has-text-black-bis">This was a project I worked on in the Winter of 2023. The goal of
                            this project was to create a web application that would allow users to to view recipes and
                            add reviews to the recipes. This was implemented for a class that had a focus on full stack
                            web development. The application was created using Node.js and a RESTFull API with a MongoDB
                            storage config for the backend. The front end was created using REACT and was deplyed to an
                            Azure Container APP.

                            The application was able to store recipes and reviews in a database and display them to the
                            end user. The end user was able to view the recipes and add reviews to them. I took great
                            pride in the UI styling of this application. This was a super informative project as I
                            learned a lot about common web development practices and how to deploy a web application to
                            the cloud.

                        <p class="has-text-black-bis"> For this project my goal was to use reinforcement learning to
                            teach an agent to play the game Othello. I used a deep Q learning algorithm to train the
                            agent to play the against an opposing random agent. The agent was able to learn to play the
                            game and was able to beat their opponent with varrying degrees of success. This is due to
                            the nature of training an agent against a completely random agemt. The agent was able to
                            learn to play, but it was unable to learn a strategy that would work consistently against a
                            random opponent.

                            of 2022. I learned a lot about reinforcement learning and how to apply it to a game
                            enviornment. I also learned a lot about how to program an implementation of a game in
                            Python. I also learned a lot about the challenges of training an agent to play a game and
                            how to evaluate the success of the agent.

                            the outcome of pokemon battles from the website Pokemon Showdown. Pokemon as a game is
                            unfathomably complex, each player will enter a game with a team of 6 monsters, chosen out of
                            the 1,015 possible. If each player has 6 of these possible creatures and cannot repeat then,
                            without even taking attacks or abilities into consideration, then there are a possible 2.18
                            * 1035 states before a game even begins. From there the game just gets more complex.
                        </p>
                        </br>
                        <p class="has-text-black-bis">The program I wrote to challenge this problem was a terminal based
                            python program that ended up working with about 60% accuracy. For this I used scikit learn
                            and random tree classifiers in order to predit the outcomes of scraped battles from the
                            website mentioned earlier. This is better than a coinfilp and is successful in my eyes.

                            mentioned above, Pokemon is an incredibly complicated game. This make the barrier of entry
                            extremly high for new players. So to help combat this issue, I made a chatbot to help new
                            players get a grasp on the game.</p>

                            For this project I used the Open AI GPT3.5 turbo model to create a chatbot that could help
                            new players. In the back, the chatbot had access to a Weaviate Vector Database to enable
                            Retrival Augmented Generation (RAG). So in the end I created a very capable and factual
                            chatbot to help new players step into the world of competitive Pokemon.

                            the various subreddits that would have interesting and relavant opinions to what I was

                            create a program that could take a recipe from a website and convert it into a machine
                            readable
                            format. This was done using a Python program that utilized webscrapping to get the
                            recipe
                            from the
                            website and then used a natural language processing library to convert the recipe into a
                            machine or
                            robot readable format. The idea was to get instructions such as "preheat the oven to 350
                            degrees"
                            into a form that a robot could understand and execute. So using the example above, the
                            program would
                            tell the robot to "heat oven".

                            conjuction
                            with a
                            class. The goal was to
                            program a robot to follow a wall utilizing a q-learning algorithm. The robot in question
                            was
                            a
                            turtlebot 3 that was controlled using a Python program using the Robotics Operating
                            System
                            (ROS).
                            The learning was done within a Gazebo simulation complete with a model of the robot and
                            the
                            wall it
                            was to follow. The robot was able to learn to follow the wall with a decent amount of
                            success.

                            great learning experience. I learned a lot about the ROS system and how to program a
                            robot
                            to learn
                            from its environment. I also learned a lot about the challenges of working with a

                            robot and
